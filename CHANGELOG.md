## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Go module and repository skeleton: `cmd/sparky-server` and `cmd/sparky-agent`
  entry points that load and validate their environment configuration and fail
  fast on startup, per ARCHITECTURE.md Application Lifecycle. No routes or
  agent protocol handling yet.
- `.gitignore`
- Database layer: `internal/db` connection pool (pgx/v5), verified with a
  ping before `sparky-server` proceeds past startup, per ARCHITECTURE.md
  Application Lifecycle. First migration (`000001_create_users`) creates the
  `users` table per SCHEMA.md.
- Documented the `golang-migrate` CLI install step (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
  now that `migrations/` actually exists and Database Setup/Migrations depend
  on it.
- `sparky-server` now actually loads `.env` on startup (`godotenv`), so
  CLAUDE.md's documented `cp .env.example .env` workflow works as written. A
  missing `.env` is treated as expected (production never has one); a
  present-but-malformed one logs a non-fatal warning. `sparky-agent` is
  unaffected - its local dev convention is a secrets file, not `.env`.
- CLAUDE.md: a disposable-Postgres-via-podman recipe in Database Setup, and a
  warning against `apt install python3-migrate` - an unrelated package Debian/
  Ubuntu's command-not-found hook suggests for the same `migrate` command
  name.
- `internal/db`'s `UserRepository`: create, find-by-AD-SID, update last
  login, and update tier (elevation), matching the `users` table per
  SCHEMA.md. Covered by integration tests against a real Postgres instance,
  per ARCHITECTURE.md Testing Strategy - they skip cleanly if `DATABASE_URL`
  is unset rather than failing.
